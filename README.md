## USER STORIES

As a citizen/user I want a web application that allows me to enter an address and receive back a list of  elected officials representing that location including their office, party affiliation, and contact information.  I would also like any pertinent voter registration and ballot information that might be available.   This would help me be a better informed and engaged citizen as well as provide me information about the political climate of where I live or where I might be interested in moving to.
